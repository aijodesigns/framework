HTML 
=================
This is the starting point for every HTML mockup with all the main elements. They can be renamed, moved, added to, etc. 
(Note: "Footer" div can be moved out of the wrap to allow the footer elements to appear at the bottom of the page.)

CSS 
=================
This is the starting point for every CSS mockup with all the main elements. They can be renamed, moved, added to, etc.

You can import Twitter Bootstrap or Zurb Foundation for additional framework.

JS
=================
This is the starting point of the site.js file. It includes helpers, spotlight cyclers, and ie7 fixes. They can be renamed, moved, added to, etc.
